# VBA---Challenge
The initial Challenge was straight forward. I created a code to find the ticker, yearly change and total volume first. I tried this code on all pages of both workbooks 
to work out any kinks without having the additional time factor of looping through all sheets. 
When I added in the looping for all sheets in workbook I did run into trouble, after many iterations of the code I reached out during office hours and Grace was able 
see the one of my variables was outside of the loop, after moving the variable (k) into the loop the code worked.
Finally I wrote the code for the bonus. I originally misread the instructions and found the values across all worksheets not for each sheet individually. After resetting 
the value to zero at the end of the sheet for each bonus value I was able to find each value for the sheet not the workbook.
